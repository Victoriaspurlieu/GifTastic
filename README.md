# GifTastic

In this assignment we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. 

## Getting Started
Instructions:

1) Enter a term into the search box.
2) As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below.

Note: If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

The theme for this web-page is not limited to Sports Gifs. You can search any other Gifs of different themes.

* CSS3
* JavaScript 
* [Twitter-Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Framework
